Implementing Genetic Algorithm and test it with Game of Life
- We used Genetic Algorithm concept to develop our own algorithm to select and mutate
- With given Random seed to generate initial patterns(1000) using Game of Life schematics
- These patterns will go through selection and mutation processes
- Genetic algorithm will determine the best one within those patterns by comparing their generations and growth rate
- The best pattern will be passed into Swing window application(UI) to run
- The application will pause when the count of best pattern matched one in the console
